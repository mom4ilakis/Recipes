### Instructions

**Step 1**  
Combine sugar and yeast in a bowl. Pour in milk, butter, and egg. Whisk together until sugar is dissolved. Stir in flour, a portion at a time, until mostly moistened, adding more if dough is too wet. Add salt and stir until a soft, slightly sticky dough comes together.  
**Step 2**  
Cover dough with a damp towel and let rise in a warm spot until doubled in volume, about 1 1/2 hours.  
**Step 3**  
Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish with 1/2 tablespoon butter. Split peaches in half along the seam and slice halves into quarters, then eighths.  
**Step 4**  
Transfer dough into the buttered baking dish. Use a spatula to spread dough out to the corners of the dish. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise once more until roughly doubled in volume, 30 to 45 minutes.  
**Step 5**  
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).  
**Step 6**  
Arrange peach slices onto the dough, pressing them in lightly. Drizzle remaining butter on top. Sprinkle Demerara sugar over peaches.  
**Step 7**  
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the cake, not through a peach, comes out clean, 40 to 45 minutes.  
**Step 8**  
Heat apricot preserves up with a splash of water and brush glaze over the top of the cake. Let cool to room temperature before slicing.
