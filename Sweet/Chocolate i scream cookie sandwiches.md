### Instructions

**Step 1**  
Cover the flat side of 4 cookies with melted dark chocolate; tap the cookies lightly to smooth out the chocolate.  
**Step 2**  
While still wet, use a piping bag or spoon to make a ghost shape with the white chocolate; tap lightly once more to smooth as needed. More white designs can be added to the dark chocolate background if desired.  
**Step 3**  
Use melted dark chocolate to make the eyes and screaming mouth; tap or shake once more to even and smooth out.  
**Step 4**  
Let chocolate cool until hard and dry to the touch, at least 1 hour.  
**Step 5**  
Scoop ice cream on 4 remaining cookies, and cover with the tops. Carefully press to flatten, and transfer to a freezer to freeze thoroughly before serving.
