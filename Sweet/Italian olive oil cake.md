### Instructions

**Step 1**  
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line the bottom of a springform pan with a round piece of parchment paper and generously grease with olive oil. Grease the sides of the pan with olive oil as well.  
**Step 2**  
Combine flour, salt, baking powder, and baking soda in a bowl; whisk together until evenly combined.  
**Step 3**  
Combine eggs, sugar, olive oil, milk, honey, and orange zest in a second bowl. Starting slowly at first, whisk together until mixture is smooth. Stir in flour mixture until everything is just mixed together and flour has disappeared. Do not overmix.  
**Step 4**  
Pour batter into the prepared pan and tap pan a few times against the work surface to remove any air bubbles.  
**Step 5**  
Bake in the preheated oven until the cake is browned on the surface and a wooden skewer inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, 60 to 70 minutes. Make sure to not overbake.  
**Step 6**  
Transfer cake to a wire rack and allow to cool for 30 minutes. Loosen edge of the cake by running a knife around the sides of the pan. Remove from the pan and allow to cool completely, another 30 minutes. Dust with powdered sugar if desired.
