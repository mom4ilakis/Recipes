### Instructions

**Step 1**  
Make the batter: Combine milk, flour, water, eggs, oil, sugar, salt, and vanilla in a blender. Blend until completely smooth, 1 or 2 minutes, scraping down the sides as needed. Let batter sit at room temperature for 30 minutes.  
**Step 2**  
Meanwhile, make the filling: Whisk ricotta cheese, cream cheese, egg, 2 tablespoons powdered sugar, lemon zest, and salt together in a mixing bowl until thoroughly combined. Cover and refrigerate until needed.  
**Step 3**  
When batter has rested, heat a 10-inch, nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Spray with cooking spray and pour in about 1/4 cup batter. Immediately swirl batter around to coat the bottom of the skillet. Cook until the surface looks dry, about 1 minute. Flip crêpe and briefly cook the other side, about 30 seconds. Transfer to a plate. Repeat to cook and stack remaining crêpes.  
**Step 4**  
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking dish.  
**Step 5**  
Spoon 3 to 4 tablespoons filling onto each crêpe, about 1 inch from the edge nearest you. Fold the edge over filling and flatten slightly. Fold in both sides, then roll crêpe into a small filled rectangle (blintz), ending with the seam on the bottom.  
**Step 6**  
Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Working in batches, cook several blintzes at a time until golden brown, turning gently, about 1 minute per side. Transfer to the prepared baking dish.  
**Step 7**  
Bake in the preheated oven to firm up the filling, about 12 minutes.  
**Step 8**  
Cool blintzes for 10 minutes, then dust lightly with remaining powdered sugar and serve.
