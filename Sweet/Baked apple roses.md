### Instructions

**Step 1**  
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Adjust an oven rack to the middle position. Butter two (6 to 8-ounce) ramekins and dust with white sugar.  
**Step 2**  
Place apple slices on a microwave-safe plate, overlapping slightly if necessary. Microwave on high until slices slightly soften, about 45 seconds. Cover the plate with plastic wrap and a kitchen towel.  
**Step 3**  
Mix together sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl.  
**Step 4**  
Roll puff pastry sheet to less than 1/8-inch thickness. Using a pizza cutter, cut two (3x12-inch) rectangles. Reserve remaining pieces for another use.  
**Step 5**  
Spread melted butter over dough; sprinkle with a generous amount of cinnamon sugar. Place apple slices along one long edge of dough, about 1/4 inch beyond the edge, overlapping slices slightly. Fold the bottom half of dough over apple slices to form a long "folder" of dough with rounded edges of apple slices exposed.  
**Step 6**  
Beat together egg and water in a small bowl. Brush surface of dough with egg wash. Sprinkle with cinnamon sugar.  
**Step 7**  
Starting at one end, roll dough to form a rose-shaped pastry. Seal roll with end of dough strip. Transfer roses to the prepared ramekins. Sprinkle with cinnamon sugar.  
**Step 8**  
Bake on the middle rack in the preheated oven until well browned, about 45 minutes. Use tongs to remove the ramekins to a baking sheet to cool for 5 to 10 minutes. Remove apple roses from the ramekins and finish cooling on a wire rack. Dust with confectioners' sugar before serving.
