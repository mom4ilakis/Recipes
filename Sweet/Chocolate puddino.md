### Instructions

**Step 1**  
Combine chocolate chips, salt, and cayenne in a heat-proof measuring cup; set aside.  
**Step 2**  
Separate eggs by cracking one egg into your hand over a bowl. Open your fingers slightly and gently jiggle your hand until the egg white falls into the bowl below. Transfer the yolk to a skillet. Repeat with remaining eggs. Reserve egg whites for another use.  
**Step 3**  
Add sugar, milk, and cream to egg yolks. Whisk thoroughly, breaking egg yolks first, until well combined.  
**Step 4**  
Place skillet on the stove over medium or medium-low heat. Cook, stirring constantly with a silicone spoon, until very hot and thick enough to coat the back of the spoon, about 5 minutes. An instant-read thermometer should read at least 175 degrees F (79 degrees C). Remove from the heat.  
**Step 5**  
Set a fine sieve over the bowl of reserved chocolate. Strain the custard sauce into the chocolate and let sit for 2 minutes. Whisk until chocolate has melted and custard sauce is smooth and shiny, about 2 minutes. Add vanilla and butter; stir until butter has melted, about 1 minute.  
**Step 6**  
Pour warm custard sauce into 6 serving glasses. Tilt each glass and rotate it around so the warm chocolate coats another 1/2 inch of the glass. Cover with plastic and place in the refrigerator until completely chilled, at least 3 to 4 hours.  
**Step 7**  
Combine cream and vanilla extract for topping in a metal bowl and whisk until thickened; make sure no peaks form. Spoon cream into the glasses, then tilt and twirl to coat the sides a bit.  
**Step 8**  
Garnish with shaved chocolate and serve.
