### Instructions

**Step 1**  
Preheat the oven to 275 degrees F (135 degrees C).  
**Step 2**  
Remove fat from pork; cut meat into 2-inch cubes and roughly chop fat.  
**Step 3**  
Mix together pork meat and fat with garlic, olive oil, orange peel, orange juice, salt, bay leaves, black pepper, cumin, cinnamon, and 5-spice powder in a large bowl until pork is coated completely. Transfer mixture to a 9x13-inch baking dish. Cover the dish tightly with heavy-duty aluminum foil, then place on a baking sheet.  
**Step 4**  
Bake in the preheated oven until pork is fork tender, about 3 1/2 hours.  
**Step 5**  
Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.  
**Step 6**  
Remove garlic, orange peel, and bay leaves from the baking dish. Transfer pork to a colander set in a bowl. Pour accumulated juices from the baking dish over pork. Return pork to the baking dish and drizzle with some accumulated juices.  
**Step 7**  
Cook under the preheated broiler for 3 minutes. Drizzle more accumulated juices over pork and continue broiling until crispy, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer pork to a serving plate and drizzle with remaining accumulated juices.
