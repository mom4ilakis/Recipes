### Instructions

**Step 1**  
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).  
**Step 2**  
Cook bacon in a nonstick pan over medium heat until almost crisp, about 5 minutes. Add onion and poblano pepper and saute until onion turns translucent, 5 to 6 minutes more. Add peach and cook until tender and starting to give off some juice. Remove from heat and transfer to a bowl.  
**Step 3**  
Stir thyme leaves, black pepper, salt, cayenne, and saltine crackers into the peach mixture. Add 2 tablespoons chicken broth if needed for added moisture. Refrigerate until needed.  
**Step 4**  
Cut a pocket in the center of each pork chop, starting with a small incision on the fat side of the chop, exactly halfway down. Use the tip of the knife to cut as close to the edges as possible without poking through. Try to make an incision at least 2 inches wide.  
**Step 5**  
Fill the pockets with the stuffing, packing and pressing in firmly. Season both sides of the chops with salt.  
**Step 6**  
Heat olive oil in an oven-safe pan over high heat. Sear chops in the hot oil until browned on one side, about 3 minutes. Carefully turn the chops over and transfer the pan to the center of the oven.  
**Step 7**  
Bake in the preheated oven until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the centers reads 145 degrees F to 150 degrees F (63 to 66 degrees C), about 15 minutes.  
**Step 8**  
Remove chops from the pan to a plate and cover loosely with foil.  
**Step 9**  
Return the pan to the stovetop and place a towel over the hot handle. Add 1/4 cup chicken broth and balsamic vinegar. Bring to a boil while scraping the bottom of the pan with a spoon to deglaze. Turn off heat and stir in butter. Adjust seasoning if desired and serve over pork chops.
