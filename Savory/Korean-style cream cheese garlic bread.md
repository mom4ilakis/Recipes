### Instructions

**Step 1**  
Combine warm water, yeast, sugar, and 1 cup flour in a bowl. Let rest for 30 minutes.  
**Step 2**  
Add 2 cups flour and salt to the bubbly yeast mixture. Beat with an electric mixer fitted with a dough hook until dough is fairly smooth, elastic, and tacky but not sticky, about 5 minutes. Feel free to add more flour if dough is too sticky.  
**Step 3**  
Knead the dough briefly before transferring to a lightly greased bowl. Cover and let rise until doubled in size, about 2 hours. At the 30-minute and 60-minute marks, uncover and fold dough with wet fingers 5 to 6 times to develop gluten structure.  
**Step 4**  
Transfer to a work surface and press flat, squeezing out excess air. Divide with a bench scraper into 6 equal portions. Roll each portion into a smooth ball.  
**Step 5**  
Transfer rolled dough balls onto a Silpat®-lined baking sheet and press down gently. Dust lightly with remaining flour.  
**Step 6**  
Cover with a clean kitchen towel and let rise for 30 minutes.  
**Step 7**  
Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).  
**Step 8**  
Bake rolls in the center of the preheated oven until lightly browned, 20 to 25 minutes. Transfer to a cooling rack and let cool to room temperature, about 30 minutes. Increase the oven temperature to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).  
**Step 9**  
While rolls cool, make cream cheese filling. Mix cream cheese, sugar, salt, black pepper, cayenne, parsley, green onions, and heavy cream together with a spatula until combined.  
**Step 10**  
Mix melted butter, garlic, salt, parsley, and egg together for coating with a whisk until combined.  
**Step 11**  
Transfer cooled rolls back onto the lined baking sheet. Use a sharp knife to make 6 cuts on each roll, about 90% of the way through.  
**Step 12**  
Dip the cut rolls into the garlic butter and coat in between the slits using your hands or a pastry brush.  
**Step 13**  
Pipe or spread 1/6 of the cream cheese mixture into each of the 6 rolls. Coat each once more in the garlic butter mixture. Top with Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.  
**Step 14**  
Bake in the center of the preheated oven until beautifully browned, 15 to 20 minutes. Let cool slightly before serving.
