### Instructions

**Step 1**  
Season the top of the salmon fillets with salt, pepper, and a little cayenne. Spread 1/2 of the melted butter all over the surface. Sprinkle with chopped dill, and drape 2 slices of smoked salmon over each fillet, covering the surface and sides. Place prepped fish in the fridge until needed.  
**Step 2**  
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).  
**Step 3**  
Spread mashed potatoes into 2 baking dishes (I used oval ramekins), and set salmon fillets on top. Sprinkle a little cayenne over the top if desired. Set baking dishes on a baking sheet for easy transfer.  
**Step 4**  
Roast salmon in the preheated oven until internal temperature in the center of the thickest part of the fillet reads 135 to 140 degrees F (57 to 60 degrees C), about 20 minute.  
**Step 5**  
Once roasted, brush the remaining melted butter over the top of the salmon fillets and garnish with green onions. Serve with lime wedges.
