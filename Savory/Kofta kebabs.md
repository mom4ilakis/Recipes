### Instructions

**Step 1**  
Cut toasted bread slice into thin strips on a cutting board; cut strips across into a small dice.  
**Step 2**  
Place onion, parsley, and garlic on top of diced bread on the cutting board; chop until mixture resembles tabbouleh.  
**Step 3**  
Season beef and lamb with kosher salt, black pepper, allspice, paprika, cardamom, nutmeg, and cayenne. Add onion mixture and water. Mix and mash with your hands until well combined.  
**Step 4**  
Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate until chilled, at least 1 hour, up to overnight.  
**Step 5**  
Remove meat from the refrigerator and roll ¼ of the mixture into a ball using wet hands. Pierce in the middle with a bamboo skewer. Shape meat into a uniform log, about 6 inches long and 2 inches wide.  
**Step 6**  
Meanwhile, preheat a charcoal grill until coals are very hot.  
**Step 7**  
Place kebabs on the hot grill until browned and cooked through, about 12 minutes, turning every 3 minutes or so. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of a kebab should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Serve.
