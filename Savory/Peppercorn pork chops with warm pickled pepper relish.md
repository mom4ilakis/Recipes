### Instructions

**Step 1**  
Place all peppercorns on a cutting board and use the flat bottom of a heavy pan to crush them as finely or coarsely as you like. Transfer crushed pepper into the pan.  
**Step 2**  
Make 3 cuts through the fat on each pork chop and season generously with salt. Apply a generous coating of crushed peppercorns to both sides, pressing into the meat firmly as you do, until fully coated.  
**Step 3**  
Transfer chops to a rack set over a pan and let sit out at room temperature for 1 hour, turning halfway through and reapplying crushed peppercorns as necessary. Or, place in the refrigerator for 4 to 12 hours.  
**Step 4**  
Meanwhile, prepare the pepper relish while the chops are dry-brining: combine poblano pepper, orange and red bell peppers, garlic, salt, cayenne, and rice vinegar. Mix to combine and cover with plastic wrap. Leave on the counter for 1 hour.  
**Step 5**  
Heat oil in a pan over medium-high heat until very hot and starting to shimmer. Add pork chops and sear for 5 minutes per side. Use tongs to turn chops while you brown the edges for another 1 to 2 minutes. Reduce heat to medium if the pan is too hot and begins to smoke. Chops should firm up and spring back to the touch. Do not overcook. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 140 degrees F (60 degrees C).  
**Step 6**  
Turn off the heat and transfer chops to a plate. Cover loosely with foil and let rest.  
**Step 7**  
Add chicken broth to the hot pan. Turn heat to high and bring to a rolling boil. Add pickled pepper relish and stir with a spoon, scraping all the bits from the bottom of the pan. Cook until liquid in the pan reduces by about half, about 3 minutes.  
**Step 8**  
Turn off the heat. Add cold butter and any accumulated juices from the plate of pork and stir until butter has melted.  
**Step 9**  
Serve pork chops with plenty of hot pickled pepper relish over top.
