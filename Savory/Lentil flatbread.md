---

### Instructions

**Step 1**  
Add lentils and water to a blender, or food processor and soak for at least 3 hours.  
**Step 2**  
Blend lentils until they are very smooth. Season with salt. (Batter can be used immediately, but for best results refrigerate overnight).  
**Step 3**  
To cook, heat a non-stick pan on medium-high. Grease lightly with olive oil and allow to get hot. Add 1/4 to 1/3 cup of batter to the hot pan. Use the bottom of a ladle or spoon to spread out into a 5 or 6 inch circle. Lower heat to medium, and adjust from there if needed. Cook the first side for about 1 1/2 to 2 minutes, before flipping over. Cook the second side for about 2 minutes, before transferring to a plate.  
**Step 4**  
Keep warm flatbreads covered with a towel while cooking and stacking.
