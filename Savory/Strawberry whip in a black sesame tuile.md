### Instructions

**Step 1**  
Combine diced strawberries and sugar for the strawberry whip in a bowl and mix well. Refrigerate for 2 to 3 hours, tossing occasionally.  
**Step 2**  
While strawberries are macerating, make the tuile cups. Combine flour, sugar, melted butter, egg white, sesame seeds, vanilla extract, and salt in a bowl. Whisk for 2 minutes or until very smooth.  
**Step 3**  
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheet2 with silicone baking mats.  
**Step 4**  
Spread a heaping spoonful of batter onto the silicone baking mat and spread it into a circle about 5 1/2 inches across. Two per pan are recommended, since you have to shape them while still hot.  
**Step 5**  
Bake in the preheated oven until the center of the tuile is golden-brown, with the edges darker brown, 10 to 12 minutes.  
**Step 6**  
While hot, transfer the tuile cookie into a small bowl, and press down in the center with a smaller bowl to make the bowl shape. Wait about 30 seconds, and remove the inside bowl, and allow the tuile to cool fully.  
**Step 7**  
To finish the whip, add cold heavy cream to the macerated berries and whisk until medium-stiff peaks form.  
**Step 8**  
Spoon the whip into the tuile cups and serve immediately.
