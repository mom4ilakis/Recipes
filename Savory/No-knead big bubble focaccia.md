### Instructions

**Step 1**  
Stir yeast into bread flour in a bowl. Add salt, followed by 4 teaspoons oil, and water. Stir with a spoon until a wet, sticky dough forms.  
**Step 2**  
Cover and let sit at room temperature for 12 to 14 hours.  
**Step 3**  
Uncover dough and transfer to an oiled work surface. Using oiled hands, press and push the dough into a rectangle, 16x12 inches in size. Fold dough into thirds horizontally; fold vertically into thirds. Transfer smooth side up into a generously oiled pan.  
**Step 4**  
Cover the pan with plastic wrap and let rest until almost doubled in size, for 1 hour.  
**Step 5**  
Using oiled hands, fold once more into thirds horizontally, then into thirds vertically to develop gluten structure. Flip dough, smooth side up, on the pan; cover with plastic wrap and let rest for 1 hour more.  
**Step 6**  
Unwrap and stretch and fold dough once more in each direction using oiled hands.  
**Step 7**  
Transfer, smooth side up, into a generously oiled metal baking pan. Lightly drizzle with additional olive oil and stretch to fit the pan. Cover and let rest for 2 hours.  
**Step 8**  
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C)  
**Step 9**  
Unwrap and poke holes in the top of the dough using oiled fingers if desired for the traditional focaccia look. Scatter over rosemary and flaky sea salt.  
**Step 10**  
Bake in the center of the preheated oven until browned, about 30 minutes. Let cool in the pan for 10 minutes; transfer to a wire rack and let cool to room temperature, about 30 minutes. Slice and serve.
