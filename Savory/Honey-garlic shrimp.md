### Instructions

**Step 1**  
Make sure shrimp are fully thawed and well drained. Keep in the refrigerator while you make the marinade.  
**Step 2**  
Whisk garlic, honey, ginger, soy sauce, and fish sauce together in a bowl.  
**Step 3**  
Add shrimp and toss thoroughly with a spatula for 2 minutes until completely coated. Cover with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator for 30 to 60 minutes; toss occasionally while marinating.  
**Step 4**  
Brush a large nonstick skillet with oil and heat over high heat until you begin to see small wisps of smoke. Use tongs to immediately transfer shrimp into the hot skillet in a single layer. Set excess marinade aside.  
**Step 5**  
Sear shrimp for 2 minutes, then flip over. Dump in marinade and cook for 1 minute. Turn off heat and flip shrimp once more; let sit for about 1 minute. The marinade in the pan will reduce down to a beautiful glaze just from the residual heat in the pan. Garnish with green onion.
