### Instructions

**Step 1**  
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).  
**Step 2**  
Melt butter in large, oven-proof skillet over medium-high heat. Add mushrooms; season with salt, and cook and stir mushrooms until brown. They will begin browning after the moisture evaporates.  
**Step 3**  
Reduce heat to medium and stir in onion. Sprinkle with black pepper and cayenne pepper. Cook and stir until onions are translucent and soft.  
**Step 4**  
Pour rice into skillet and stir until each rice grain is coated with butter. Season with salt.  
**Step 5**  
Pour 1 cup chicken broth into the rice mixture. Raise heat to medium-high and cook, stirring rice until liquid is completely absorbed by the rice.  
**Step 6**  
Pour another cup chicken stock into the rice and stir until mixture comes to a simmer.  
**Step 7**  
Bake in preheated oven until grains are almost tender but still slightly firm, about 15 minutes. Transfer skillet to stovetop. Season with more salt, if necessary.  
**Step 8**  
Combine the remaining 1/2 cup chicken broth and cream; pour into the skillet. Cook on medium heat, stirring constantly until rice is tender, 1 or 2 minutes. Remove skillet from heat.  
**Step 9**  
Drizzle 2 tablespoons cream over rice. Add the grated Parmigiano-Reggiano and chives; stir. Serve immediately.
