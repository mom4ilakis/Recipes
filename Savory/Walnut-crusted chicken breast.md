### Instructions

**Step 1**  
Mix garlic, 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard, and thyme together in a bowl.  
**Step 2**  
Season chicken breasts generously on both sides with cayenne, salt, and pepper. Spread Dijon mixture on both sides of chicken until fully coated.  
**Step 3**  
Firmly press walnuts onto both sides of chicken breasts. Keep covering with more walnuts and pressing until chicken is thoroughly coated. Refrigerate for 1 1/2 to 3 hours.  
**Step 4**  
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).  
**Step 5**  
Coat the bottom of an oven-proof skillet with 1 tablespoon olive oil. Place chicken breasts on top, reserving excess nuts if desired. Season with a pinch of salt and drizzle remaining olive oil over top.  
**Step 6**  
Bake in the center of the preheated oven until walnuts are lightly toasted and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of a breast reads 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), about 25 minutes. Be careful taking the pan out of the oven; keep the handle covered with a towel or mitt at all times.  
**Step 7**  
Quickly transfer chicken to a plate to rest.  
**Step 8**  
Transfer the skillet to the stovetop and stir in broth, remaining 1 tablespoon Dijon, and honey. Add any reserved nuts if desired, and bring to a boil over high heat; cook until reduced by about half, 3 to 4 minutes.  
**Step 9**  
Spoon pan sauce over and around chicken to serve.
