### Instructions

**Step 1**  
Scoop out as many potato balls as you can per potato using the smaller end of a Parisian scooper, 8 or 9 balls per large potato. You can't get too many out of each potato. If you want perfectly shaped balls, don't scoop too close together.  
**Step 2**  
Drop potato balls into a large bowl of cold fresh water so they don't discolor. Use potato carcasses for another use, e.g. potato pancakes.  
**Step 3**  
Add potato balls, water, and kosher salt to a large pot. Stir and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Once water is boiling, boil for just 2 minutes. Potatoes should still be firm, but not raw.  
**Step 4**  
Turn off heat and remove potato balls with a strainer. Allow to drain in one layer on a plate lined with paper towels. Cool until they are room temperature.  
**Step 5**  
Heat clarified butter in a skillet over medium heat for 2 minutes. Carefully add completely dry and cooled potatoes to butter. Brown potatoes until outsides are golden and crispy, and the insides are tender and fluffy, 7 to 10 minutes. Move and stir potatoes often so they brown evenly .  
**Step 6**  
Remove from heat and serve immediately.
